NOTE for Windows environment            2017-03-08

Original source files are for Linux/UNIX environment with
 - LF linefeed/line break character
 - tabulator character is 8 spaces


To see the source codes correctly with any Windows text editor/viewer, open files from the directory:
    Windows sources

The modifications:
 - line feeds are CR/LF like in Windows
 - no tabulator characters, so indentation is correct with all text editors
